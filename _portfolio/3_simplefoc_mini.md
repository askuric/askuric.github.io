This is a miniature board designed to be small, low-cost, and easy to use. They are intended for low power applications and are designed to be compatible with the SimpleFOClibrary. The boards are created as minimal working examples and are intended to be used as a reference design for the community to build upon. The boards are fully open-source and the fabrication files are available in the respective repositories, as well as detailed guides on how to fabricate the boards yourself. The boards are additionally available in the shop for those who prefer to buy them, as well as on other mainstream platforms like Aliexpress and Ebay (no relation to the SimpleFOCproject).
